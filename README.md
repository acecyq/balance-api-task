## Questions
__1. (Optional) If you didnâ€™t have time to complete your intended design, what else would you have done?__
> ANSWER

__2. Which took the most time? What did you find most difficult?__
> I feel the hardest would be to handle ES modules and Common JS imports. Have been working mostly with older versions of Node and have not come across this issue.

__3. If we wanted the balance to update on the frontend more often (10 times per second), how would you improve the current system to handle this?__
> 10 times per second sounds pretty fast so I think I might use websockets instead.

__4. How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them!__
